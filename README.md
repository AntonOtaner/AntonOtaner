### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm a developer from Montreal, Canada, passionate about designing responsive interfaces and writing clean code. I'm comfortable developing for the front end and the backend code. I've also worked with exciting technologies such as machine learning and blockchain. For a more detailed explanation, please visit my portfolio at [otaner.dev](https://otaner.dev).

### ðŸ’» I'm currently working at
* [Ericsson](https://www.ericsson.com/) on the [Maritime Mesh Network](https://www.ericsson.com/en/ericsson-one/maritime-mesh-network)
* Otaner Tech on a financial web app

### ðŸ“½ Some of my projects include
* Portfolio: Minimalistic landing page made with Gatsby.js to showcase my projects
* Chat App: Real time web chat application made with React.js and Firebase.js where users can create personalized chat rooms and communicate with strangers across the globe
* Atomz: Financial and blockchain web application using Express.js, Node.js, Firebase.js, TensorFlow and Solidity to track personal finances and analyse assets in international markets
* Tetris Artificial Intelligence: AI using the NEAT genetic algorithm made with Visual Basic to play Tetris
* Mobile Games: Three arcade mobile games made with Unity and Xcode 

### ðŸ¤” Some common FAQS
* Why do you have no public repositories? Almost all of the projects that I have done have been for school or for business, implying that the codebase must essentially be private. I am aiming to contribute to open source projects.
* How long have you been programming? Around six years!
