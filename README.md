### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm a developer from Montreal, Canada, passionate about designing responsive interfaces and writing clean code. I'm comfortable developing for the front end and the backend code. I've also worked with exciting technologies such as machine learning and blockchain. For a more detailed explanation, please visit my portfolio at [otaner.dev](https://otaner.dev).

### ðŸ’» &nbsp; I'm currently working at
* [Ericsson](https://www.ericsson.com/) on the [Maritime Mesh Network](https://www.ericsson.com/en/ericsson-one/maritime-mesh-network)
* Otaner Tech on a financial web app

### ðŸ“½ &nbsp; Some of my projects include
* Portfolio: Minimalistic landing page made with Gatsby.js to showcase my projects
* Chat App: Real-time web chat application made with React.js and Firebase.js where users can create personalized chat rooms and communicate with strangers across the globe
* Atomz: Financial and blockchain web application using Express.js, Node.js, Firebase.js, TensorFlow and Solidity to track personal finances and analyze assets in international markets
* Tetris Artificial Intelligence: AI using the NEAT genetic algorithm made with Visual Basic to play Tetris
* Mobile Games: Three mobile arcade games made with Unity and Xcode

### ðŸ¤” &nbsp; Some common FAQS
* Why do you have no public repositories? Most of the projects that I have developed have been for school or business, implying that the codebase must essentially be private. I am aiming to contribute to open source projects soon.
* How long have you been programming? Around six years!
